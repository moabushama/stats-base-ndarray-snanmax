## üìö Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: What is a NaN value?**  
A: NaN stands for "Not a Number." It represents a value that does not represent any value at all, often used in numerical arrays.

**Q: Can I use this application for more than one array?**  
A: Yes, you can run the application multiple times with different arrays to find maximum values.

**Q: Do I need to install Node.js again?**  
A: Only install Node.js if it's not already on your system. Visit the Node.js website for the installation instructions.
